# Adventure Game Kit: A Toolkit for Creating FHE-Based "Choose Your Own Adventure" Games

The **Adventure Game Kit** is an innovative toolkit designed for creators to effortlessly build complex branching "text adventure" games while harnessing the power of **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**. This platform simplifies the integration of interactive storytelling by allowing writers and creators to protect player data and narrative paths securely.

## Identifying the Challenge

In an era where privacy and data security are paramount, creating engaging narrative experiences often compromises user information. Traditional narrative-based gaming platforms do not offer sufficient privacy controls, exposing players' choices and states to potential exploitation. Writers and developers face a daunting challenge: how can they craft immersive interactive narratives without sacrificing their audience's safety and privacy?

## The FHE Solution

Our toolkit leverages **Zama's open-source libraries**—including **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**—to implement FHE, enabling the encryption of player attributes and narrative branches. With FHE, all player decisions and game states can remain confidential while still influencing the storyline, allowing for rich and personalized experiences without ever revealing sensitive information. By using this advanced cryptographic technique, creators can provide a secure environment for players, fostering trust and encouraging deeper engagement.

## Core Features

- **Visual Story Branch Editor**: Create intricate story paths with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that requires no programming skills.
- **FHE-Secured Player Attributes**: Encrypt player data and choices, ensuring that all interactions remain private and secure.
- **Story Locks**: Introduce dynamic obstacles or requirements based on player attributes to create unique gameplay experiences.
- **One-Click dApp and NFT Publishing**: Easily publish your game as a decentralized application (dApp) and mint unique story endings or characters as NFTs, opening up new revenue streams for independent creators.
- **Empowering Independent Creators**: Designed with the creator economy in mind, our tools empower storytellers to own and monetize their narratives without needing extensive technical expertise.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: JavaScript, React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Confidential Computing**: Zama’s FHE SDK (Concrete, TFHE-rs)

## Installation Guide

To set up the **Adventure Game Kit**, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
2. Install Hardhat or Foundry to manage your smart contracts.
3. Download the project files.
4. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.
5. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will fetch the required Zama FHE libraries and other dependencies.

## Build & Run Guide

After installation, you can compile and run your project using the following commands:

1. **Compile the smart contracts**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run tests**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Launch the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command will start your application, allowing you to create and test your text adventure game live.

## Example Code Snippet

Here's a simple example of how to use the Adventure Game Kit to create a branching storyline:

```javascript
import { createStory } from 'adventure-game-kit';

const myAdventure = createStory({
    title: "The Lost Treasure",
    branches: [
        {
            question: "Do you want to go left or right?",
            left: {
                outcome: "You found a hidden cave! 🎉",
                locked: false,
            },
            right: {
                outcome: "You encountered a dragon! 🐉",
                locked: true,
                requirement: "dragon_armor",
            },
        },
    ],
});

console.log(myAdventure);
```

In this example, players can choose to go left or right, leading to different outcomes. The right path is locked unless the player possesses the required attribute, showcasing FHE's capability to manage dynamic gameplay.
